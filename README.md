# TimeOfCity

This program will receive a city name and return its time. For now the idea is for it to work in 3 stages: You enter the city, and using an openweathermap.com API it will return a latitude and longitude. Then using that lat and long it will use some API (not found yet) to return an Olson Time Zone. Finally, using a timeapi.io API, entering the Olson Time Zone will return the desired time.
